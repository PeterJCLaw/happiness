			<h4>About Happiness:</h4>
			<p>
				The file browser down the LHS performs the majority of the file control.
				Files can be opened via a click, and renamed in place.
				Files are moved by dragging (within a project) to the desired location.
			</p>
			<p>
				It also handles displaying which files are already open, though this has little meaning really, by showing a highlight on the open files.
				If a file is open, but would be off the top of the scroll (not sure how we work that out, but it's an idea),
				 then it shows at the top of the list, popped out of its project tree.
				Clearly such files can't be picked up and moved about -- the user needs to scroll them into view before they can rename/move them.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bar above here with the sections buttons are part of this dummy version of happiness only, and will probably be removed.
				This leaves the left &amp; right panes as the only parts of the page.
				Alternatively, we might have a common user-bar across the top, similar to what Google has (suggested by rbarlow at TD1).
